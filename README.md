# FULLSET Node-RED Repo

This is a github repository for the code/flows used in Node-RED as part of the wider FULLSET system.

This repository is essentially a common data environment to access one-source-of-truth flows for use in FULLSET.

The flows in this project are either to be used on the FULmax CAVE PC (only by Alex) or on the individual Raspberry Pi sensors (Alex + MSc students).
